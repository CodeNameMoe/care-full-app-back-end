# **_Care-Full App_** üè•üêàüê∂üêá

Welcome to Care-Full!

Having a sick pet is a stressful situation, on top of our already busy lives, this additional stress can make it difficult to remember the specific details of your pet's illness and their needs.

This app aims to alleviate some of the stress that comes with having a sick pet by providing the user with an easy way to track symptoms and medications and facilitate better communication with their vet.

This repository holds the code to make RESTful API's, it runs on an Express Server, making queries to a POSTGRESQL Database. The credentials for the database will be stored in your environment variables.

The server handles requests to a database with 3 tables that allows for users to add and update pet details as well as adding symptoms and appointments.

The Care-Full website makes fetch requests to this server when running locally.

**This README is for the Back-end of the Care-Full app. If you would like to explore the Front-end of the app please go to the [Front-end repository](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/final-project_front-end-team-con-cat-enate-room-7)**
